edit_startup
	copy over the add_investors.php page,
	make a php script(in the page) that selects all details for any individual startup in the database 
	show these details in their respective fields.
	ignore the founders fields, since those send their details to antoher database. remove those fields from your form
	create an update-startup.php action that updates the affected data.
	the id of the field to edit should be gotten through a GET parameter, i.e localhost/nguvu/edit_startup?p=1
	any other tasks you deem necessary

edit_deal,edit_investor
	copy steps above, modify and improve

env.php
	As you've been taught, it's best to have a different environment file for localhost and another for the live server.
	Life is too short for me to make that many files. I just have an if statement that decides whether the content is on a server or on localhost.
	it then sets the variables.
	it has the db login details, holds the path where i store logos, and other variables.
	So feel free to comment out the values in the first array, and place your own values there.

DB structure
	The db is made of an invesotrs table, a startups table, and a deals table. there are many auxilliary tables that support these main ones. many columns in the startup table simply hold foreign keys pointing to values in other tables. 
	Regarding what each table is, how it came to be, and it's description(not necessary for your task, but helpful in the long run), I can share a google sheet with the database structure.

good luck figuring this all out, and don't hesitate to ask questions!
